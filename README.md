# Deep-Learning-Developer-Projects-2

## Project 1 : Dense Net.
Learning to perform addition operation using a fully-connected/dense neural network. 

## Project 2 : CNN
Classification on a Quickdraw dataset. 
Used a Inception module ConvNet coupled with SNN(Self-Normalising-Network) propety using SELU(Scaled Exponential Linear Units) as activations. 
Trained the inception modules from scratch.

## Project 3 : RNNs
Sentiment Analysis on the imdb dataset. 
Trained both word embedding layer as well as a layer of GRU.

## Project 4 : Speech Enhancement.
CNN+BiRNN on noisy speech.
Further using Conditional GANs.
  To look into using WGANs.

## Project 5 : TBC
  Diarization?
